  <h1>Intro</h1>
  <p>The following are simple visualization for a ball clock. 12 and 24 hour instances are demonstrated. Each clock has controls that will simulate a tick. By default each tick has a rate of 1 minute. It should be noted that the animation does not try to simulate the full path actual balls would travel.  Rather given a rate, and a tick action the final locations of each ball is calculated and then each ball travel to its new location. Hence, if you have rate of 120, each tick may appear nonsensical </p>

  <h1>Number Systems</h1>
  <p>The rules that govern a ball clock are very similar, arguably a superset, of the rules that govern most modern number systems. It is beyond the scope of this page to list the differences but it is trivial to simulate various number systems with a ball clock.</p>
